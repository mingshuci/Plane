# H1

I picked this question because it qualifies as an opinion question. I chose a bar chart because it effectively displays the different responses to the question "Is it rude to recline your seat on a plane?" along with the count of respondents for each response category.

# H2

The chart shows the distribution of opinions among respondents regarding the etiquette of reclining seats on a plane. It reveals that a majority of respondents do not find it rude at all to recline their seats, while a smaller portion finds it somewhat or very rude. This visualization helps in understanding the general sentiment and the extent of agreement or disagreement on this topic.
